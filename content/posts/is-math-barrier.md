Do you want to learn robotics but are concerned that math might be a barrier? Are you scared of math and anxious when doing it?  Don’t worry, math need not be hard. There are proper ways to learn math. In addition, you need not be a math wizard to learn robotics. You can become a pro in robotics while still taking in the deep mathematical concepts slowly. In this post we will understand about math anxiety, how to overcome it and ways to learn math the right way. So that when you are ready to learn robotics, math is no longer a barrier but a friend to deepen your understanding.

## Introduction: What is mathematics
First let us look into what is mathematics? Mathematics is a field of study where one uses numbers, symbols and formulas to solve problems. It is a way of thinking. 

Mathematics deals with the abstract ideas of number, space, and change. Mathematics is a language for expressing our thoughts and ideas about these abstractions. It is a subject that helps us understand the world around us. Mathematics is not just numbers and equations. It is more than that. Mathematics has been around since ancient times. It is the basis of all sciences. It has been used for thousands of years to solve real world problems. It is a language that we use to communicate with each other. It helps us to understand nature and our universe. Mathematics is the foundation of all sciences. It is also used in many other fields such as engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, robotics, etc.

But, why do we need math? We live in a world where everything is measured and calculated. From the time we wake up till the time we go to sleep, we are constantly using math. Math is everywhere. In addition to being used in our daily lives, it’s also used in business, science, medicine, and engineering. Math is a universal language. It is the language of nature. The only thing that makes math different from other languages is that it’s the only one that is built on its own foundation.

In addition to the fact that we use it everyday, it is also part of our daily lives. For example, when you go to the grocery store, you will see the prices listed on the shelf with a unit price. The prices are all in cents, so you can multiply by $2.00 to find out how much it costs.

When you are paying your bills, you will be given the total amount due. You will then be asked if you want to pay in one lump sum or multiple payments. If you pay in multiple payments, you will be asked for the number of payments you want to make. You will also be given a payment schedule. This is because you will be making payments over a period of time.

```Math is consistent and precise and it is the language of the universe```

In contrast to natural languages, math is precise. You will never have any confusion about what you are saying. You will always know what you mean. In addition, you will never have to ask someone else to interpret what you are saying. If you ask a math question, you will get an answer. You won’t get an answer like “it depends”. There is no room for interpretation. The rules are laid down and followed strictly. The reason for this is that the world around us is also precise and consistent. Math follows the same rules. It is consistent and precise.

## Relationship between math and robotics
Mathematics is important because it allows us to see patterns and understand how the universe works. Robotics is all about building machines that interact with the environment. We need to understand the underlying principles of how they work.  This means we need to learn math to better understand the environment.

This is the basic architecture of any robotic system. The first step involves “sensing” or perceiving the world. The next step involves “thinking” where the perceived information is used to form a model of the world and possible actions are deduced. This step is followed by “acting” step where actions are performed that will affect the environment or the robot itself. This loop is then repeated. 

Each of these steps involve math at deeper levels to various degrees. For example, when sensing, data is collected. This data must be processed into meaningful information. Then the information must be translated into actions that will be executed. All of this requires math. Robotics uses mathematics to solve problems, but it is not mathematics itself. Mathematics is a tool for solving problems. The more math you know, the better you can understand robotics. 

## Math anxiety: How to beat it?
If you’ve ever felt intimidated by math, you’re not alone. Math anxiety is the fear of doing math and can be very debilitating. It affects many students, including those who are already good at math. It can also affect adults who are good at math but don’t practice it. 50% of the US population, particularly women, suffer math anxiety. 

The good news is you can beat math anxiety by practicing the right strategies. Math anxiety is caused by a combination of factors, including your attitude towards math and the way you’re taught math in school, lack of practice, difficulty with the subject matter, and self-doubt. Some people seem to have a natural talent for math and able to do it without effort. However, this doesn’t mean that others have to suffer. Math is a skill that can be learned with deliberate practice. 

### But how do you overcome math anxiety?

#### 1. Don’t focus on your mistakes

You’re human, so you will make mistakes. It’s OK to make mistakes. Just correct them and move on. It’s easy to get discouraged when you make a mistake. Instead of focusing on your mistakes, focus on the process. Focus on the steps you are taking. Focus on the fact that you are learning. When you focus on the process, you’ll find that your confidence will grow. You’ll be less likely to make the same mistake again.

#### 2. Practice more math

Practice makes perfect. So the more you practice, the better you will get. As you improve your math skills, you will become more confident. This is a cycle.  Even if you don’t enjoy math, you can still practice it. It’s not just about understanding the material, it’s about being able to apply it. The more you practice, the better you will become at math. Don’t worry about being wrong, just keep moving forward.

#### 3. Change your mindset

Your mindset is everything. If you believe that you are bad at math, then you will be. If you believe that you are capable of learning math, then you will be. You can change your mindset by changing the way you think about yourself. Think about how much math you know, not how little.  You can do anything you put your mind to. 

Your mindset is the most important factor in overcoming math anxiety. You don’t have to struggle. You can be successful. You just have to believe in yourself. You have to be willing to try new things. You have to be open to feedback. You have to be willing to put in the time.  The more you practice, the better you will get. The more you practice, the more confident you will feel. You will start to think that you can do math. 

## The Art of Learning Math: How can we make math easier?

## Why does math feel hard?
Math is condensed form of information. This makes it intimidating at first because it seems like there is so much information to process. There are a lot of concepts to understand. You have to process so much information in a short amount of time. It’s easy to get overwhelmed when you first start learning math. However, if you break down the problems into smaller pieces, it becomes easier to understand. This is how we will learn math.

Math uses precise notation which makes it hard to understand at first. It takes time to get used to the notation. If you’re having trouble with math, try to find a video or book that uses notation similar to what you are used to. You need to understand the concept behind the problem. Math can be very abstract, so you need to be able to visualize the problem in your head. It’s not necessary to memorize the formulas. Instead, you should use them as a guide to solve the problem.


## How to Get Started with Math — The Right Way

### Manage expectations
Respect the complexity and set proper expectation. Be ready to devote required amount of time to cover the material. Always remember that you will not be able to master everything in one day. Begin by solving small problems and then gradually move to more complex problems. This will help you understand the concepts better. Solving problems with different levels of difficulty will help you build your confidence. Always keep in mind that the pace of learning is different for everyone.

### Make it fun
If you want to learn math, you need to be motivated. Try to find a way to make math fun. Find out what you like about math and then try to incorporate that into your learning in a fun filled way. Play it as a game. Soon you will find that math is much more fun than the other subjects. 

Games and activities are a great way to learn. If you are learning addition, you could play a game where you have to add up numbers on a board. Try to find games that you enjoy playing and incorporate them into your learning.

When you are learning math, try to see how it can be applied to real world situations. You can also find ways to apply it in your daily life. This will help you understand the concepts better.

Set up experiments to see if you get the outcome you calculated. This will give you a better understanding of the concept. You can use math to calculate the speed of a car, the trajectory of a ball, or the temperature of water. You can also set up experiments to see if you are correct. You can set up a table and test yourself. This will help you learn more effectively. You will make mistakes while you are learning math. It’s okay to make mistakes. You are not going to be perfect at math right away. Mistakes are part of learning. They are a sign that you are trying.

### Diversify source
Employ technology and explore numerous online platforms that teach math using a variety of methods. Think of your math class as a buffet. If you’re hungry, you might not be able to eat all the foods on the table at once. But if you’re willing to try something new, you can sample from many different dishes and have fun in the process. The key to diversifying your math experience is to find ways to learn math that are different from what you learned in school. There are many online resources (like www.khanacademy.org) that offer a variety of approaches to learning math. You can use technology to access these resources. 

If you can pay, you hire a tutor. The benefit of working with a personal tutor is getting more one-on-one attention from a person who knows your needs. Each person has a different view of the problem. When you work with a tutor, they will bring a different perspective to the table that may be the catalyst for you to understand the concept.
