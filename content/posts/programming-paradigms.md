Do you not know which programming language to use for your new robotic project? Are you confused about the different programming paradigms these languages are based on? In the following post, we will explore these questions.

## Programming paradigms – The basics
To start with, let’s quickly look at what a programming language is. A programming language is a set of rules that tells a computer how to do something. In other words, it tells the computer what instructions to perform in order to achieve some goal. There are different ways to give these instructions. 

`Programming paradigms are a way of thinking how to program.`

A programming paradigm is a philosophy of how to solve a problem, and different paradigms tend to solve problems in different ways. If you’ve ever wondered why some programmers seem to write better code than others, it’s because they use different paradigms.

The world of computer programming has been dominated by two distinct types of languages: procedural and object-oriented. Procedural languages are like a series of steps that you follow in order to complete a task. Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, is more like a blueprint for building something. Functional programming is a third type of language which has recently gained attention. What each of these programming paradigms are, how they work, and how they can be used to solve specific problems related to robotics is outlined in this post.

## Procedural programming  
Procedural programming is the most common type of programming. It involves using a series of steps to solve a problem. For example, you may have to add up the values of the numbers in a given range. To do this, you would write a series of steps that you follow in order to get the sum. These steps include:

- Read the value of the first number;
- Add the value of the second number to the value of the first number;
- Read the value of the third number;
- Add the value of the second number to the value of the third number. This process is repeated until all the numbers have been added together.

Procedural programming is similar to a recipe. It is a set of instructions that you follow in order to do something. The first step is to specify what you want to accomplish, then you write a list of commands that tell the computer how to accomplish the task. Once you have written the list of commands, you can test the program to make sure that it works as expected.

Procedural programming is an older programming paradigm. It was developed in the 1960s and is based on the idea that programs should be written in a way that makes it easy to understand what is going on. This means that there should be clear boundaries between the different parts of the program. Procedural programming is also very flexible. It can be used for small programs, large programs, and even complex programs. Procedural programming has the advantage of being easier to understand than object-oriented programming. Procedural programming paradigms are often considered to be the most efficient way to program because they are extremely efficient at executing code. This makes them ideal for writing large amounts of code. They are also easy to understand and follow.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-oriented programming is a way to organize your code in such a way that it’s easier to understand. It is based on the idea that the objects are the things that do the work. The programmer creates classes of objects, then defines the properties and methods that these objects should have.

You can think of an object as a type of container. It has a set of properties and methods. An object can be a person, a dog, a car, or anything else. Each object contains a set of information. For example, a person might have a name, address, and phone number. You can think of objects as the containers for all the information in your program.

A simple example of object oriented programming is a class that represents a student. A student has attributes such as name, age, and gender. A class can be instantiated to create an instance of the Student class. Instances of a Student class are referred to as objects.

The following code fragment defines a Student class:

{{< highlight go "linenos=table" >}}
class Student:

def __init__(self, name, age, gender):

self.name = name

self.age = age

self.gender = gender
{{< / highlight >}}

An object is created by calling the ```__init__``` method with the appropriate arguments. The following code fragment creates a student named “Alice” who is 23 years old and female.

```alice = Student(name=”Alice”, age=23, gender=”Female”)```

The benefits of OOP are numerous. It allows you to separate data from functions, which makes your code easier to understand. It also helps you avoid having to write a lot of duplicate code. And, it is a great way to create reusable code. When you are writing code that will be used by other people, it’s good to make sure that you’re using a style that is easy to understand. Object oriented programming allows you to take a complex problem and break it down into a set of smaller problems that can be solved in an organized fashion. OOP can also be used to make programs more efficient and easier to maintain. For example, a class can be used as a template for creating objects. By using a class, you can create objects that have similar properties without having to rewrite the code every time.  OOP is one of the most powerful programming paradigms available today.

## Functional Programming
Functional programming is the latest trend in software development. It is based on the idea of functions. Functional programming has been around for a long time. In fact, the first high-level functional programming language, LISP was developed by  by John McCarthy, in late 1950s while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In functional programming, you don’t have classes or objects. Instead, you have functions. Functions are blocks of code that perform one specific task. They can be as simple as adding two numbers together or as complex as finding the largest prime number.

A function is a mathematical term that represents the relationship between one variable and another. For example, the function f(x) = 2x + 5 represents the relationship between the variable x and the value of f(x). 

In functional programming, functions are the basic building blocks for writing programs. These functions are self-contained entities that can be composed together to create more complex structures. They are used to define the behavior of a program. Functions are not objects; they are just pieces of code that are executed when they are called.

Functional programming is different from the other two paradigms because it doesn’t have any state. It’s also different because it focuses on functions as values rather than objects. A function is a value that takes inputs and produces an output. When you write a function in functional programming, you don’t need to think about how you will use the function. You simply write a function and pass it inputs.

Functional Programming is an alternative to procedural or object-oriented programming where you are told what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. In functional programming, you are given a function, and you are asked to solve a problem by applying that function to some data. Functions are very powerful and can be used to create many different things. They can be used for data processing, creating algorithms, and much more.

 The functional programming approach to software development has a lot of advantages, including allowing developers to work more quickly and efficiently. The functional programming approach also allows developers to write code that is easier to read and understand because they can use the language’s features to express their ideas.

## Drawbacks and Challenges
Procedural programming has some drawbacks. One of the biggest drawbacks is that it is very difficult to change the program once it is created. This is because the programmer is essentially building a structure and the only way to change the program is by changing the structure. This makes procedural programs extremely difficult to maintain. 

 While object-oriented programming is intuitive, it becomes harder as the number of objects increases. When you are writing object-oriented programs, you are not just coding for yourself. You are coding for others. You have to think about how other people will use your code. If you don’t do this, you may end up with a program that is very hard to understand.

Functional programming is still in its early stages. It is difficult to learn and hard to master. So, there is a learning curve and it takes time to get used to. In addition, it is very difficult to debug functional code. It is going to be hard to get help if you get stuck, because functional programming is not widely used yet, and most programmers are still learning it.

## Considerations when choosing a programming paradigm
The decision to choose one or another paradigm is a difficult one. There are many things to consider before choosing a paradigm. For example,

- What type of programming is best for your project?
- How much experience do you have with the programming language? Are there any good books on the topic?
- How familiar are you with the paradigm?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of the paradigm?
- How easy is the language to learn?

Each programming paradigm has its pros and cons. If you are new to programming, you may want to try the procedural paradigm first. This is a very simple paradigm that is easy to learn and understand. You can gradually expand to the other paradigms like functional and object-oriented as you become more confident. These are more difficult to learn, but they can be used to create very powerful programs. 

If you are working in a team, you want to choose the one that best fits your team’s needs. If you are learning a language for fun, then you want to choose the one that is most fun to use. Generally functional programming is the best choice here. If you want to get things done quickly, procedural programming is the way to go.

## Programming paradigms for robotics projects
The type of programming paradigm that you use in your project will affect how easily the robot will be able to accomplish tasks, how easy it will be to debug, and how well it will be able to learn.

Paradigms are like templates. When you create a robot, you are programming the robot to follow a template. It’s important to know what kind of robot you want to build before you start programming.

Some paradigms are better suited to robotics than others. For example, procedural programming is best suited for robot in an industrial environment, where a set of steps is repeated over and over again without much change in the environment. Procedural programming languages are good at controlling the execution of instructions in the program.  Object oriented programming is suited to robotic applications where the robot needs to react quickly to external stimuli. On the other hand, functional programming is better suited to applications where the robot needs to perform a task or solve a problem that does not require real-time responses.

If you are starting to explore robotic applications, procedural programming is the best place to start. It’s a step-by-step approach where the robot is programmed to perform a sequence of actions. Also procedural programming is one of the most commonly used paradigms in robotics. It is a good idea to learn procedural programming because it is easy to understand and use. It is also easy to program in. Procedural programming is very similar to writing a computer program. The only difference is that you are programming a robot instead of a computer.

## Conclusion
_Procedural programming_ is best suited for applications which have linear steps without much deviations. Low-level functionality like device drivers are a good candidates here. 

_Object oriented programming_ works best in situations where we want to model complex interactions. User-interface components or other mid-level functionality are typically programmed using object oriented programming.

_Functional programming_ suites applications where we want to implement mathematical models. Higher-level functionality like state estimation or path planning can be good candidates for functional programming. 

In conclusion, the most appropriate paradigm for a given project depends on the requirements of the project. There is no single best paradigm for all applications. Each paradigm has its strengths and weaknesses. I would suggest that you choose a paradigm that you are comfortable with and that you find interesting and more importantly suites your application.
