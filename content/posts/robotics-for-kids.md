```Robots are the future—and if they aren’t your kid’s future, they’re your kid’s competition.```

Kids who are exposed to robotics and engineering at an early age are much more likely to end up with college degrees and a career in a STEM field. Robotic technology will impact every industry and every household in the coming decades. But what exactly will robots do for us? Why is it important for our kids? In this post, we will examine the answers to some of these questions and more.

## What is robotics in simple words?

Robotics is the branch of science that deals with mechanical and electrical devices that are capable of performing tasks on their own. It is a combination of electronics, mechanics, and software. Robotics can be used in various fields such as industrial automation, military, aerospace, medical, space exploration, agriculture, etc. Robots are used in various sectors such as manufacturing, construction, transportation, military, medicine, etc.

## Why should kids learn robotics?

The future of robotics is bright. Robots can help us with many aspects of our daily life, from medical care to energy production. Robots are also fun and exciting! But why do we even need robots? Here's a list of some of the things that robots can help with:

- Robots are fast and accurate
- They can move at high speeds and make quick decisions without getting confused.
- They can be programmed to perform specific tasks without being told how to do it.
- They can work in dangerous or difficult environments.
- They can operate without human intervention for long periods of time.
- Robots can be used in places that humans cannot, like on space missions.
- Robots can help us get around.

Robots are the future. They are either replacing humans or complimenting them is almost all fields. It will be essential to learn about robotics as they will be used in every facet of life — in offices, homes, schools and even hospitals. Kids can start learning robotics from very young age.

Robots can help teach your child about programming and coding. They can also be used for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) concepts. Robotics is an excellent way to get your child thinking about the world around them and why things work the way they do. Robots are also great for helping children build confidence and independence.

## What age should you start robotics?

It is never early to start learning robotics. In fact, kids learn the basics of mechanisms at a very early age. They play with toys and try to make them work. This is a great way for them to learn how things work. They are also playing around with their hands and fingers, which helps them learn about different kinds of manipulations. As they get older, they can start working on projects that involve programming and electronics.

## Why do kids love robotics?

Because it is lots of fun. Kids are naturally curious to learn how things work. Such curiosity is essential to learning robotics. The skills learned in building robots directly applies to understanding science, math and technology. There is also a coolness factor associated by being called a roboticist -- one who makes robots! It is also a great way for kids to be creative. They can use their imagination to create a robot. I think kids have a natural talent for engineering, but they need encouragement and guidance. 

## Does robotics require math?

Yes. You will need to be able to understand and manipulate basic geometric concepts, including the ability to think about and reason about them. Robotics is fundamentally about the manipulation of objects in space. The more you can do this, the more you can make a robot do. For example, if you can manipulate a single object in space, then you can use that knowledge to manipulate multiple objects simultaneously (e.g. pick up a bunch of blocks). If you can manipulate two objects simultaneously, then you can move them together, etc. 

However you need not be a math wiz to get started. Many robot kits are made with LEGO, which have simple block-like parts that fit together. You can build simple robots using only a screwdriver and some patience! As your understanding and experience deepens you can take up more advanced robotic projects that can do complex tasks. 

## Is robotics a good career choice?

I don't know what the future holds, but we are going to need lots of different kinds of work to be done in the next few decades, and I would say that robots will increasingly play a role. It's already happening today, with the robots being used in factories, warehouses and healthcare sectors. This is the most important industry there is. Robots are going to be the backbone of manufacturing in the 21st century. The factories of the 21st century will be more like a computer than a factory floor. They will be automated and controlled by robots.

The robot revolution is going to be very disruptive. We're going to see major changes in jobs, in how people live and work and in our whole economy. But it's not going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take decades. I don't want to put too much emphasis on the idea that there will be no jobs. But if you look at history, technology has always created new jobs and improved the efficiency of existing ones. In the 19th century, there was mass unemployment, and then there were all these new jobs being created for people who could now afford to buy things, because there were factories and they were making a lot of products.

## Conclusion

Robots are coming. They are coming to take our jobs. They are coming to make our lives easier. They are coming to do our chores for us. They are coming to make us smarter. We have already seen how they can be used to help astronauts walk on the Moon. The day is not far away when robots will be everywhere and we'll be in their service.

Robotics has a bright future. It's safe and will give kids a chance to build up their skills and get excited about technology. The best thing you can do for your child is to expose them to as many opportunities as possible. It's important to start young if you want them to be successful. In order to build a career, they need to find something they enjoy and are good at it.
