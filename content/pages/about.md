Ever since I was a child, I have harbored a deep passion for robotics. However, I faced challenges in finding the right direction and connections to enter this field at an early stage. Nevertheless, I have persevered and made it here today. Now, I aim to assist individuals who find themselves in a similar situation to what I once experienced. BuildRobotZ is my way of imparting knowledge to those who lack the necessary resources and guidance to enter the world of robotics.

Depending on where you are in your robotics journey, I will assume various roles, whether it be your trainer, coach, or mentor, to help you reach your goals as quickly as possible. Together, we will construct fun and captivating robots that maximize the learning experience along the way. Join me on this exciting journey of learning and building robots.

In the blogs section, I share my insights on a range of captivating robotic topics that have caught my attention. If this interests you, be sure to sign up for our newsletter.
